Dev Jijilal, Sam Elmore


Project Description:
HiNote is a social media platform that aims to connect individuals through music. Users are able to rate and review songs and albums, as well as view others’ ratings and reviews. Additionally, the app uses an algorithm that analyzes users music listening history data in order to connect them with other users that they may have similarities with. The algorithm takes into account songs listened to, listening frequency, listening times, location, etc. in order to connect users with other similar individuals.

Phase 1:
Goal- Create the base for the iOS app.
In phase 1, we will create a tangible product through which users can create and view their own ratings and reviews. 

Phase 2:
Goal- Incorporate ‘social media’ aspect
In phase 2, we will develop a framework through which users can share reviews/ratings with others. Additionally, users will be able to interact with each other through a like/dislike + commenting system.

Phase 3: 
Goal- Develop connections between users
In phase 3, we will develop the algorithm used to connect users based on metrics such as songs listened to, listening frequency, listening times, location, etc.
